# Advent of Code 2024
These are my scripts for the puzzles at https://adventofcode.com/2024 . Same as last year, I will be uploading all days that I solve with a short commentary on thought process/description. All the puzzles (so far) have been solved without looking up any hint related to the event. Note that my naming process for the input texts is input + the date. So for the first day it was input1.txt, the second day input2.txt... etc.

## Day 1
The first days are generally fairly easy, so I didn't expect much. Part 1 was mainly about sorting 2 lists and taking the absolute differences of their elements, initially I messed up because the puzzle said to find their "distances" and I thought it meant the difference between their positions. Part 2 was similarly easy it just required a simple operation between the lists.
